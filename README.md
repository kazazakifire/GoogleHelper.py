# GoogleHelper.py


Context:
Found my search regularly switching to my browser to search for answers while coding. I created this program so I can run google searches from my Terminal in visual studio code. 
The results in the search query are also opened in new tabs.

Usage:
python GoogleHelper.py your search query here
